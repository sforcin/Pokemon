A Project description:

Why is it important or interesting to you?
  This project allows for creativity and an ability to be flexible with the details such as characters, attack strategies, and levels. It gives an opportunity to expand once a basic skeleton is made, allowing us to add components if time permits. 

What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use?
  We will use C++ and a command line interface, along with some C++ standard libraries. We don’t plan on using any external libraries at this time. 

What will be the input/output of your project?
  The input of the project will be from the keyboard input from users and also files that can be read. The output will be text output to the console as the game is being played and also data being written to files.

What are the features that the project provides?
  Ability to store previous games (ongoing or completed) 
  The ability to load previous games to be resumed.
  NPC’s having predetermined actions based on user input
